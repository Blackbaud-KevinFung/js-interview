# js-interview

Welcome to the Alegion Front End interview question!!  This question is designed to not take too long to implement
but also be a fun and challenging experience.  Please feel free to reach out and ask any questions while you are 
working on a solution.  You can e-mail rtester@alegion.com with your questions.  Good luck!

## Project Technical Requirements:
- Application must be built with React, Redux and ES6/7.  All other dependencies are up to you.
- Instructions must be provided to run the application, install any dependencies, and any other information needed to start
interacting with the application.

# Overview:
You will be building a basic user management tool that will perform basic CRUD operations on a user. Please refer to the mockup
with any questions regarding the UX of the application.  Remember that you will need to explain how you solved this problem when 
you come in for an interview. When you commit changes to your Repo please include a detailed description of what is in it. To get 
started please fork the repo and then submit a Pull Request when you are done. 

## Mockups

- [Edit Mode](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/alegion-js-interview/Desktop_List_Edit+Mode.png)
- [Delete](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/alegion-js-interview/Desktop_List_Edit-delete.png)

### Definition of Done
- User will be able to view a list of users from the api and display them according to the mockup.
- User can edit a user following the mockup
- User can create a user.  There is no mockup for this so just create a modal dialog with the required fields.
- User can delete a user following the mockup


### API:
All API interactions will be using https://reqres.in/.  If you go to the homepage and scroll down a little bit you will see the 
api documentation needed to fetch the initial list of users.  All other operations should use the appropriate api endpoint to
perform the action needed.
